Music Store Analysis
Overview
This project, titled Music Store Analysis, aims to analyze a music store database using SQL queries. The database consists of 11 tables containing various information related to the music store's operations. The queries in this project utilize PostgreSQL, incorporating joins, common table expressions (CTEs), and subqueries to answer 12 specific questions regarding the data.

Files Included
music_store_database.sql: This file contains the SQL script to create the music store database with its 11 tables.
music_store_queries.sql: This file contains SQL queries that analyze the music store database, providing insights into various aspects of the business.
queried_questions.txt: This file lists the 12 questions posed for analysis along with their corresponding SQL queries and results.
Database Structure
The music store database comprises 11 tables, each representing different entities and aspects of the music store's operations. The tables include information on customers, employees, products, orders, and more. The structure of the database facilitates efficient storage and retrieval of data for analysis.

Queries
The SQL queries in the music_store_queries.sql file are designed to answer specific questions about the music store's operations. These queries utilize various SQL features such as joins, CTEs, and subqueries to extract relevant information from the database. The questions cover a range of topics including sales performance, customer behavior, product popularity, and employee performance.
